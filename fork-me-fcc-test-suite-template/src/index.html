      <h2>Growing and Care Tips:</h2><br>
      <ul id="tribute-info">
        <li><strong>Light</strong>: This plant needs bright light, even including some direct sunlight, to bloom well. However, it requires shielding in direct midday summer sun, which can burn the leaves of younger plants. A good position is in a room with windows facing east or west. Avoid rooms with only a north-facing window.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Water</strong>: Keep the soil continually moist throughout the year. Bird of paradise prefers high humidity and you might want to keep a spray bottle handy to mist it if your home is dry. If overwatered the plant will develop crunchy brown leaves. If underwatered the leaves farthest from the center will turn yellow.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Temperature</strong>: Keep the air temperature above 60 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter. This is not a cold-tolerant plant, and it recovers slowly from frost damage.
      </li><br>
        <li><strong>Soil</strong>: Use rich, well-drained potting mix.</li>
      </ul><br><br>
